More than 25% of entire revenue in E-Commerce is attributed to apparels &amp; accessories. A major problem they face is categorizing these apparels from just the images especially when the categories provided by the brands are inconsistent. 

The dataset of Zolando's article image has 60,000 examples in training set and 10,000 examples in test set.
Every image is a 28x28 grayscale picture, related with a mark from 10 classes.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

Label	Description: 
0: T-shirt/top, 1: Trouser, 2: Pullover,3: Dress,4: Coat,5: Sandal,6: Shirt,7: Sneaker,8: Bag,9: Ankle boot
